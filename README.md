# SAINT
This is a Symbolic Integrator inspired by 1963 James Slagle's program for the IBM 7090.

Slagle's original SAINT program was able to solve 52 of 54 elementary symbolic integration
problems taken from the MIT freshman calculus final examinations.
Original SAINT was based on pattern recognition, and internally generated a Goal Tree to 
attempt solutions for the integral problems.

My version of SAINT aims not only to replicate the ability to solve any (solvable) elementary 
integral problem, it additionally aims to allow writing the input functions as close to
the conventional way as possible.
